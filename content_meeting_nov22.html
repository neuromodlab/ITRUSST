<h3>Meeting proceedings</h3>
<p>

    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Thanks for joining. This is the plenary meeting of ITRUSST of November and today we'll have an overview from the safety group presented by Jean-Francois Aubry on a proposal for consensus on biophysical safety. The timeline is that a draft of that proposal has been circulated both as a PDF on emails. If you hear from other ITRUSST members who haven't received it, my many apologies. There are indeed sometimes emails from Google Groups that don't cut through spam filters, please do contact me directly. We've also shared a link to a shared folder. Jean-Francois has done a tremendous effort in getting all of this to the current stage. Suggestions and constructive feedback can be directed to me or put in the shared folder in the comment section. This will be discussed within the safety group which will lead to a revised proposal of consensus or if hardly anything needs to be changed, we'll be updating you another plenary meeting. We hope to move this process swiftly, so we would love to ask all of you for your swift cooperation and feedback and to look at the first draft and proposal aready in November. That’s done so we can actually circulate multiple versions. Now that's it for my site and I would love to hand over to Jean-Francois.

<h3> Presentation Safety working group</h3>
<p>    
    <b>Jean-Francois Aubry:</b>  Thank you very much. So what I will do is give you a brief overview of the documents. The overall idea we already discussed this more than a year ago in fact, so I basically updated the slides. What took us a long time was to phrase it and to be all on the same page and write a consensus among us.
    <br><br>
    If you remember I gave almost the same presentation more than a year ago except that it was the first draft and we stated that this was a draft. Now it is what we believe is all export consensus on biophysical safety. As discussed before, we are discussing physical safety, not in neurophysiological safety. This will be discussed completely separately.
    <br><br>
    How did we translate to us to clinics?  We try to build on an existing guidelines or recommendations that that we could find from other fields. The closest guidelines are imaging guidelines mostly. We are all aware that we are not doing imaging, we're doing therapy – so all the guidelines do not apply directly to what
    we are doing but we kind of look what could be applied to what we are currently doing. We considered mostly two safety issues; mechanical safety and thermal safety. Concerning mechanical safety, currently everyone in diagnostic ultrasound is using the mechanical index that was introduced for this purpose to
    assess the mechanical safety in diagnostic imaging. So basically, it is the big negative pressure divided by the square root of the frequency. Currently it is recommended to have a mechanical index lower than 1.9. One important thing is that the mechanical index was first introduced for very short first period: one single cycle of ultrasound.  It corresponds to the cavitation correction as assessed with the threshold for gravitation bubbles who would collapse to a temperature of 5000 Kelvin. This is a numerical model and they came up with a limit in terms of peak negative pressure that is needed in order to induce such a thermal rise. There's been some work to extend a little bit to longer (up to 14 periods) and this was from Charles Church. The result was that it increased the mechanical index by 25 percent. 
    What we did is that we looked at experimental cavitation thresholds, so we can increase the model. We could adapt the model by going back to some experiments to see how far we from damage into tissues are. It’s very far from tissues, 1.9 is the limit but we see in the living tissue in the brain the lowest threshold to be able to detect cavitation 15 in terms of mechanical index. It was also determined in a set of different tissues and tissue Phantom.  Again the threshold should actually see cavitation occurring when MI is equal to 13 to 24 and if we increase the duration of the communication this should correspond to the the definition of MI for diagnostic ultrasound.  So you see here for diagnostic ultrasound, it was very conservative. We are using continuous waves still higher than 1.9 so the safety group as a consensus consider that mechanical risks are negligible if the mechanical index everywhere in the tissues (skin, scalp, and brain) is less than 1.9. We define here ‘everywhere in tissues’ but  it corresponds actually to the point where the peak refraction or pressure is maximum. So it's up to you to determine where is the big maximum pressure in the brain. We believe that even though we are losing using long pulses, we can still use this formula and use this to assist the mechanical safety in terms of thermal safety. There exist some standards and for example in imaging it is stated that the temperature should be less than 39 degrees. I would say recommendation applies two degrees, the temperature should be less than two degrees at all times when the device is imprinted. A second consideration is that temperature rise of 2 degrees would be in keeping with the thermal rising limits for other biomedical devices. That's one way to ensure the safety, we see that there are also other ways of assessing the safety but at least we would consider that less than two for sure. This is about standards for imaging. We also found some consensus again for imaging not considering the thermal rise but the thermal dose. In the paper, we provide the reference but basically they consider that the safety limit for the brain is 10 cumulative equivalent minutes of 43 degrees, so this is the standard units for thermal dose. It corresponds to its equivalent to an exposure time of 10 minutes at 43 degrees. So both two degrees or 10 cm are safe, it is just that the two degrees thermal rise can be considered as safe but it has more constraint. There are
    other standards that can be used in the FDA. Again for Diagnostic ultrasound, the thermal index was introduced. It is the power needed to raise the temperature by one degree and they introduced different indexes: one is the soft tissue thermal index when there is no bone, another index is TIB bonus focus thermal
    index for cortical neurostimulation. Bonnet surface or TIC would be for deep brain stimulation with ultrasound and there are ways to to estimate the TIC. There's been extensive work in the past in trying to
    model the absorption of ultrasound in the bone and to kind of overestimate the thermal rise – to make sure that this approach is safe.
    <br><br>
    You have to consider both the thermal rise and the time it's almost the equivalent. The thermal dose is  another way to estimate the maximum energy that you can apply when applying ultrasound. We believe that
    the mechanical risks are negligible when the MNI in the brain is less than 1.9 How to ensure this the two
    ways to do it: you can either consider and measure the MI in water using G rating and take into account only the absorption from the skin and the brain. If you are already lower than 1.9, it means that with the skull in place, it will be even lower so you're good to go. If you end up with a mechanical index that is higher than 1.9, it might still not be dangerous if you take into account the insertion loss of the square. In that case, it would depend on the frequency that you are using. 
    <br><br>
    As we described in the paper, we propose three ways to account for the insertion loss. You can either provide some experimental measurements, thus measuring the transmission through the skull. If you do so, you need to account for entire individual variability, the skull thickness, and the shape of the skull with vary from patient to patient. Clearly measures that would be performed on one scale only cannot capture such variability, so you need to make sure that you cover a wide range of different geometries and thicknesses of square. If you do so, another way is to use analytical models of the skull. The safety group proposed an analytical model by taking into account the thickness of the bone and the absorption. We presented it at the first symposium two weeks ago and we submitted this paper. Hopefully it will be available in the coming months. The last possibility is to develop a numerical model to estimate the attenuation induced by the skull. 
    Overall recommendation on thermal safety: we consider that thermal risks are very limited if any of the following is true: either the TIC or make sure that the temperature is in the tissues is not raised by more than two degrees at any time during the exposure time. In that case, you're safe. Or you can ensure that the thermal dose is less than 10 cumulative equivalent minutes. 
    <br><br>
    For assessing the thermal rise, we propose three different methods. If you do not wish to use thenTIC then you might try to estimate the temperature of the thermal rise or the thermal dose. In that case again as before, you can either provide some experimental measurements with thermocouples or with MR thermometry. You have to make sure that this is representative of a population of patients, volunteers, or skill models. You might use analytical models like the TIC but you might also propose other analytical models describing the attenuation of the beam through the skull and estimating thermal rise. Again you need to validate this model. Or you might use numerical models if you can propagate and simulate the propagation of the ultrasound beam. Then you can use the thermal code estimating the thermal rise but again you have to validate your approach. To summarize, TIC is just the easiest route to go but we agree that it's very conservative
    <br><br>
    Thank you for attention, this is the overview you had access to. We are open to discussion. I would like to highlight here that we wanted to make sure that we could provide useful tools to make sure that TUS is safe. This is the first set of the first consensus as the field is evolving if we gather more information about thermal or mechanical safety that supports some increase in the MI or increase in the temperature that we might allow. If we have to make a balance between the risk and the benefits, so far we hope that there will be benefit to the patient; that it would be efficient, effective, but surely here we hope that if you follow those guidelines it should be at least completely safe. We did not see any report of any damage thermal or mechanical when considering the recommendations that we propose here.

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> In the draft in the proposal: for example when we refer to 10 minutes a cumulative equivalent minutes of 43 to 10, 743; we refer to it as a safety limit because at that those thermal dose I believe it was in dogs or a kind of foreign cats that there was evidence of damage in the brain.
    <br><br>
    <b>Jean Francois Aubry:</b> On humans, this was on the skin not on brain but the thresholds for not permanent damage but first degree burn, threshold was 100 cm .
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> The cited work is from Ever Rone. In Figure 6 they list at which thermal doses the first evidence of any effect and I believe there the lowest value ever reported for the brain and that was in the dog is nine cumulative minutes and therefore their recommendation is that this is a safety limit. There's never ever any evidence that below nine there was any consequence of that thermal dose but that's slightly different than guidelines. A safety limit is the moment where you might have seen any effect or that could pose a safety risk. Let's take an analogous; here we have the mechanical index where you could argue that in a worst-case scenario with a continuous the lowest mechanical index would ever observed any cavitation might be 3.5. Then 1.9 is a guideline in this case that is proven very effective to counter for.  I think there's a very big difference between the recommendation of two degrees Celsius thermal rise and 10 743 -- I think it might even make a lot of sense to list both of them but perhaps we should then be a little bit more clear on what is a recommended guideline and what is the evidence for the safety limit. If we're talking about practice, we could argue that if you're approaching the safety limit you should do so in a controlled fashion where trained and dedicated people are present. Now that's not what this consensus proposes about right. We're not giving any recommendations on how to control your situation.
    <br><br>
    <b>Jean-Francois Aubry:</b> We will just have a closer look with the committee about this value. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> For some of those, you've done an amazing job of listing both the regulatory guidelines and the evidence for safety limits. We could even present those next to each other, you could say that this has abundance of evidence that it is safe and that the risks are truly neglible, for example, MI 1.9, but there has never been any report of a cavitation between 1.9 and 3.5, even in worst case scenarios. So that's the distinction between what is a guideline and what is a safety limit.
    <br><br>
    <b>Jean-Francois Aubry:</b> Yes you're right, but I have just to make sure for example that the 10 cm is acceptable as a guideline and as a consensus if we believe that it's safe. We need to look at the safety limit that was reported. I need to double check this. I was already particularly concerned about skin burns because the pressure is higher on the outer part of the bone so I was expecting skin bursts to happen maybe quicker than damage to the brain. So this is the reason why we looked at the limit for first degree skin bone that was well above the 10 cm but then I know that the brain is more sensitive to heat. So I will clearly double check this 10 cm.
    <br><br>
    <b>Yoshikazu Ugawa:</b> Can I have one question? To my knowledge is 40 degrees actual definite damage on brain but not skin and we don't mind any skin. Maybe we'll feel some heat, and our subject can detect that something happens. But about the brain, we can detect it and with 40 degrees completely damage occurs even structural. These studies off cells is done because of the mobile phone effect and 40 degrees is not permitted.  I don't understand two degrees is safe already accepted consensus. For example, if something happens with 2 degrees, maybe 1 degree is in safety diagram and with 2 degrees something happens. Sometimes one-tenth, if they take to 2 degrees 0.2 degree is in the safety diagram to use as a safety guide. To my knowledge, 1 degree increment in the brain is okay. Three degrees is definitely bad. Two degrees, I don’t think that is good. Everybody knows that how duration two degrees increment is only one second, but 1 degree increment for 10 minutes is not okay but 2 degrees 10 minutes; I don’t agree with it.
    <br><br>
    <b>Jean-Francois Aubry:</b> Temperature alone is not enough to assess the safety. The pressure and salutation time, it’s both combined together. I couldn’t argue for temperature higher htan 43 but 42 degrees for 0.016 seconds is not a problem for the brain, so it’s not only in terms of temperature but temperature over time. When you use diagnostic ultrasound for Doppler Imaging for several minutes, thermal rise will increase.
    <br><br>
    <b>Yoshikazu Ugawa:</b> Is the temperature in the brain or in the skin?
    <br><br>
    <b>Jean-Francois Aubry:</b> They use the TIC so it means that they kind of overestimate the temperature that can be reached because they consider that all the energy that is absorbed by the bone so that the bone and the brain is also increasing in temperature. *Shows PowerPoint slide on how to calculate TI*. If the TIC is equal to five as a proxy you could consider that the bone temperature and the brain adjacent to the bone will be almost increased by five degrees for 10 seconds so it’s 45 degrees and this is for diagnostic ultrasound. What I mean is that if we set the limit too low and if we are even more restrictive, then diagnostic ultrasound maay just kill TUS. This is existing standards, this is just recommendation in assessing the effect of the bone and somehow estimating what is going to be the thermal rise is not an easy thing, it is difficult. But it’s just to make sure that the temperature of the bone and to surround tissue.
    <br><br>
    <b>Yoshikazu Ugawa:</b> I don’t mind the bone.
    <br><br>
    <b>Jean-Francois Aubry:</b> Yeah but that’s the only way to somehow estimate the maximum temperature of the brain because it should be lower than the temperature that is reached in the bone. We all know that the temperature in the bone is increasing by let’s say two degrees then it will radiate towards the skin and towards the brain. So if the temperature of the bone is close to two degrees it means that within the next 30 seconds or so the temperature of the brain might also be two degrees.
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> May I raise another perspective on this because what you’ve highlighted and that specifically about the temperature in the brain is for example the standards, not for diagnostic ultrasound but for MR and implantable devices. Those also list either 39 degrees or the 2 degrees Celcius and they do consider the brain. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Jean-Francois Aubry:</b> For the implantable medical devices, it can be electrodes in the brain, the only limit that is currently imposed is two degrees so they can go up to two. But they are implemented, thus permanent, so it could be 1.9 degrees forever, that would just be a load.
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> But nonetheless there is quite a difference in dose between two degrees and 10 743. Brad did a quick calculation in the chat. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Yoshikazu Ugawa:</b> *As answer to Samuel Pichardo’s question in the chat*. The situation of TUS as an examination is quite very different from the surgery. Before surgery, sometimes there is a bit in increment of 42 for a few seconds or minutes. But even though in that case doctors think that if something pathological occurs near there, it’s okay. But in the examination we should not give any permanent effect on the normal brain, so the situation is quite different. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Samuel Pichardo:</b> For surgery, we don’t go directly to high power, we are doing very mild excavations and while we reach like a 40 42 degrees which is enough to have a good immersed thermometer signal. We know that that doesn’t cause damage and we don’t want to cause damage on those temperatures because sometimes  it helps to verify the focused spot is at the right location. So just to make the comments; the evidence based on focused ultrasound surgery both support the safety limit if you are less than 40 degrees or up to 40 degrees, high likely there’s no damage at all.
    <br><br>
    <b>Jean-Francois Aubry:</b> I think that the issue that you are currently having is completely linked to the CEM which is the threshold to induce a lesion. We will check if it’s ten or if we could set to 1 or 0.1 to make sure that it’s extra safe. We have somehow to support the fact that it’s safe or not, we will need some evidence of damage for some threshold; what’s the threshold and how far away is it? We cannot just set the limit to 1, 2, or 3 degrees or 0.1 degree without knowing how far we are from a region.
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Sorry to jump in. Professor Ugawa, I think we would all be very thankful if you wouldn’t mind sharing some of the work that you’ve referred to. I’m not fully familiar with the cellular phone, I’m familiar with the debate but I’m not familiar with the original research and papers. I think that it would be very helpful. And indeed, Jean-Francois, I agree with you that that is what we should be doing here as a consensus. I just want to highlight here very briefly; for example, this (plot cats and dogs) was from the wrong paper. The lowest they ever observed indeed was nine cm for the skin. For humans, it was a lot higher, higher than 100cm in their reported paper. This is to me what I know as the evidence-based approaches of the lowest thermal dose to ever lead to any observable effect or even thermal damage in these tissues. That’s exactly what the safety group has done. Collect all of the information present and maybe indeed for the thermal dose we've now hit upon what is the safety limit; the lowest dose ever to lead to any damage are ever reported. When we're setting recommendations, it might also be helpful to set these far enough away.
    <br><br>
    <b>Jean-Francois Aubry:</b> Yes, if you heard of any relevant study from the cell phone, it’s very interesting. I guess there is some evidence of maximum power of absorption in tissue but do they consider for example that one user could use it 24 hours 7 days per week?
    <br><br>
    <b>Yoshikazu Ugawa:</b> It’s not actually the mobile phone use, it’s a tissue experiment. It’s not the animal itself, only the cells, tissue, and increment of the temperature. Say 10 minutes; in that case the cell is damaged at 40 degrees but that is very strict condition. The temperature is correct but only the cell thus tissue culture, which is quite different from the body itself. The experiment sets 40 degrees is completely damage, but for the mobile phone safety, of course the accumulation never occurs such high, only that’s one degree in simulation. We cannot measure the temperature in humans thus culture or animal experiment, but that is quite different from my comment. So if the simulation is correct and temperature is rightly correct that is simulation. I don’t know what happens actually but the safety to cell culture is usually very strict condition. If something happened in that condition, maybe we should escape that. When I say TUS to people, every subject or even doctors consider TUS surgery and ask if it is safe. So we should be very careful to say that it is safe. If 40 a 43 degrees are okay in your simulation or animal experiment, maybe I agree but this is only my knowledge. For tissue culture it is definitely very strict incremental temperature that occurs in those cells, so maybe that’s different from the animal experiment. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Jean-Francois Aubry:</b> For the cell cultures, there is intensive literature on thermal dose, that’s how they did the first validation of the thermal dose; by looking at the number of cells that are killed and again you see the correspondence between the thermal rise and the time. So they look at the percentage of them. That’s exactly what you describe. For example, 43 degrees for 10 minutes is equivalent to 45 degrees for one minut and that’s the whole point about thermal dose and that’s exactly what they did. Once we looked at all those data in the literature showing the thermal dose, either on cells or tissues or animals, and looking at this lowest thermal dose at which there was a lesion. Then we can discuss either temperature or thermal dose. Thermal dose is most appropriate because it includes everything. I see based on the discussion that we had here, that we can double check the threshold for cm. I would have a tendency to believe that the numbers we propose here in terms of thermal rise and time for sonication with TIC are pretty safe because we did not invent anything Those are the recommendations for diagnostic ultrasound and I don’t see a reason why we would be even more restrictive for neurostimulation than it is for diagnostsic ultrasound. That’s our starting point at least. Again, I would also encourage everyone to discuss with acquisitions because calculating and estimating the TIC is not as simple as it might seem but I would trust the safety of the recommendations from AIUM in terms of values that can be admitted.
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> I can see that the clock is ticking so I’m inviting everybody to please submit their comments and please submit the papers that they feel are relevant for these discussions and for this evidence.  I wanted to bring up one other point. For me as a relative outsider to diagnostic ultrasound, I’ve always been somewhat surprised by the nomenclature of a mechanical index that I would always prefer if it was indeed labelled a cavitation index. I wonder, should we not even put a limit on the true mechanical effects, maybe on displacement or just on the pressure. Or we could say that anything that we could be placing on pressure would already be captured by the mechanical index. Secondly, the mechanical index will very likely be one of the main limiting factors in how we design our experiments and which intensities we can use. That might drive people to using in fact higher frequencies, but you need to go to quite high frequencies before the pressure is more limiting than a mechanical index I presume, or at least intensity might be more limiting.  What are your thoughts on that?
    <br><br>
    <b>Jean-Francois Aubry:</b> Yeah we might have to adjust the name, it’s true. Can we still call it mechanical index? As we know, it should only apply for short purposes so the name might change. But what I can just insert you rapidly is that the peak negative pressure will not be enough because it’s also the question about the importance of the frequency. It is pressure divided by the square root of the frequency, this is how you could capture the likelihood of activation. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Yes for the cavitation, I completely agree, I was just wondering on the mechanical effects alone. Here we really focus on cavitation risks and thermal risks but do we truly capture mechanical risks?
    <br><br>
    <b>Jean-Francois Aubry:</b> Just to go back briefly to the thermal safety, it was interesting to see professor Ugawa comment because I was somehow more expecting to react about the fact that we should allow to go for much worse (i.e., a little bit higher temperature). I was just afraid that some people would think that we were conservative, I was just hoping that we were not over conservative. I’m glad to see that actually that’s not the case. Again, we will double check for cm.
    <br><br>
    <b>Til Ole Bergmann:</b> One quick comment, I’m relative naïve to brain temperature and in its medical implications but brain temperature during fever can rise up to 42 degrees without causing any damage in the brain. Fewer typically have over some prolonged periods of time and then we’re not talking about seconds, so I think it’s important to really talk about both, the rise but also the absolute limits; so what are absolute temperatures we don’t want to reach even for very short amounts of time? For fevers, the physician also said once that it’s not only the absolute temperature, it’s actually how quickly the fever rises.
    <br><br>
    <b>Jean-Francois Aubry:</b> By the way, you see from all the discussion that we’re having now, that it also explain why it took us more than a year between the very first draft with almost the same ideas but then writing it down and making sure that at least the 14 of us in the safety group agrees with the text. You see that we have still another round of discussion about the cm. That’s just one number, so you see how difficult it is to reach a consensus and make sure that what we recommend we believe is safe.
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Thank you Jean-Francois. I invite everyone to carefully read the proposal, to look up the original literature that is cited there and to support these consensus by providing your suggestions and comments. The more they are substantiated with literature and references, the more thankful we as a safety group will be. We’ll be collecting those for the next two weeks and as a safety group, we will be reconvening to draft and perhaps a revised document but at this stage I really want tot thank everybody for their contribution, especially Jean-Francois for your immense work in pulling this though to this stage. That’s been wonderful. We’ll communicate probably in about three weeks with you , if and what we’ll be able to present at an exploratory meeting. For now, thank you all very much and I’m looking forward to seeing you soon. Don’t forget about FUN23 on the 12th till 14th of July.
