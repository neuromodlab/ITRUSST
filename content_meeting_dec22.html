<h3>Presentation Reporting working group</h3>
<p>

    <b>Kim butts Pauly:</b> So as many of you know we've been sort of thinking about the standardized reporting for a while and I think I presented it maybe like a year ago. Then we had some changes mostly because I had the smarts to engage Elly and Brad on this project. 
    I'm just going to sort of queue up what we have here and then Elly is going to get started with describing the first section. Then I’ll describe the second section and then we’ll kind of play tag team from there.
    What we have are two documents. One of them we send out to you a day or two ago and the structure of that document has basically four sections. An introduction that kind of lays out the important points that we wanted to make. So hopefully maybe you’ve had a chance to glance at it. The second section and Elly will get into this one in a bit more detail. But this one is talking about the system and free field acoustic pressure parameters. Our thought was that these were the fundamental measurements that we actually are able to make, and so we want to make sure that we get those right, and report those right. Then the fourth section is about the derived parameters that come from those, so we’ll talk a bit more about those. And then the second real section (third section) is about the pulse timing parameters, and we can talk about that a little bit as well. And then there are the derived parameters so those take both of the data from the first two sections and then we derive parameters and then lastly what we have here is ‘don't forget other things’. Because as we're thinking about it there are just a million things that we could have put in here but didn't really get to. <br><br>
    
    <b>Elly Martin:</b> So, I’ll just start with the document. As Kim said, this first sort of section goes into the quantities um that we're suggesting that people report covers the basically the kind of basic properties of your system and equipment and what the pressure field is in water. And the idea is that this should be some kind of baseline even if you know nothing else about other parameters, what the pressure is doing in the subject, and so on. You have this baseline that somebody could come along and recreate with you with the same equipment. 
    <br><br>
    So the idea is that, first of all, we talk about what equipment you used and all of these sections they relate to the ultrasound equipment and output parameters, rather than how you position the transducer and things like that as will come to you sort of later on. So, we start with a description of the transducer parameters, kind of saying what kind of transducer you had, whether it was focused, what the radius of curvature was, where the focus is, and those kinds of things. So, we have this diagram which is intended to illustrate those things.
    <br><br>
    So, in this section A here, we've just got some examples of maybe the kind of transducer configuration that you might have. So, thinking about simpler transducers here that you might just have some kind of curved transducer that provides a focus but there may be other things attached to the front of the transducer; some extra coupling medium and coupling pads and these are intended to be things that are always joined onto the transducer. So, you may have a transducer that has a flat front face with something inside it which provides the focusing: a lens or some shaping or something. Then some of these parameters are just described here just to illustrate what they mean and where you would get those from. So, just the size of the transducer and the radius of curvature of this curved focusing surface. 
      And then in this section, we're drawing out then what the pressure parameters would be in the positions relative to the front of your transducer so that could be chosen wherever it makes sense for the equipment that you're using. The idea then is that you would report some of these parameters with their locations relative to the transducer after they've been measured in water.
    <br><br>
    So, just going back. First of all, you describe the transducer and the other bits of equipment you used: how did you drive the transducer, and what was it plugged into in order to produce the signal that produces the sound? All of this stuff should be written down. 
      And then next we have the free field acoustic parameters so these are the things that maybe you measure yourself or maybe you take from a manufacturer's report so this is if you've got your transducer and it's just radiating sand into a bath of water and nothing else, then where is the peak pressure and whereas the spatial peak pressure, what is the amplitude at a given setting that you might use and then how big is the focal region, how long and how wide. So that's yeah that's basically what this is describing, and these are illustrated here that you might have some peak pressure but then you might also have a point that's defined by the middle of this focal region um and then you might report the distance of that spatial peak pressure location from your transducer surface.
    <br><br>
    Then the other part of this section just has some notes on how you might get hold of those parameters whether you measure themselves you measure them yourself or whether you obtain them from the manufacturer's datasheet. So there's lots more guidance in one of the appendices of this document which just gives a few more hints on measurement, choice of equipment and how you actually do that. And then basically just goes on to say that you should obtain an idea of what the pressure is at all of the
    output levels that you use in the study. So, if each participant, you use a different power or output setting then you need to know what the pressure is for each of those settings.
    <br><br>
    Now I will move over to the table and just show you what the idea is. So we made this spreadsheet so that it would be kind of easy, perhaps, for people to just populate it with the numbers that are needed to sort of
    fully report the study, or the numbers that we consider are needed to fully report a study. So, this first section here there are three tables here which cover these parts of the parameters. One is the hardware
    specification. So, this is describing the transducer and the equipment. So, you basically fill in on the left what you've got a transducer some way of driving it and then some sort of fundamental properties of the transducer, how it radiates, what the fundamental frequency is, the shape, and size of it, the number of elements and what kind of distribution those are in. So it says over here: “the user fills in anything that's gray”. So that's populated in the 2D units. 
      Then the driving parameters. So this is how the transducer would actually be operated during the study so what frequency you actually typed into your driving system, what your kind of output level setting which we mean to be the power or the intensity or whatever it is that you set on the front of your equipment and the focal position settings so where you've intended your focus to be. And then the next table is the actual free field pressure parameters, the numbers which tell us something about the field in water. 
      So again, this is the transducer radiating into the path of water and the way we tried to set it up so there are no reflections or anything like that. So it's a kind of different setup to how it will be used in the experiment but it forms this baseline that can always be recreated. So all the quantities go in here: the spatial peak pressure amplitude, by amplitude we're assuming that all the signals are linear at this point so when we say amplitude we literally mean the amplitude of the sine wave and that should be the same as both the peak positive and the peak negative pressure. So, we explain this in the document. If you put that in, then you should have all three of those things. 
      The position of the peak pressure which you explain where your reference plane is so whether that's from the transducer surface or the front of the outer bit of the housing and then the shape and size of  the focus and the acoustic output power, if you know it.
      <br><br>
    Any questions?
    <br><br>
</p>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>
    <b>Keith Murphy:</b> If you have a beam that's steered like off-axis, would you take your transducer plane then project it out, and then use that as the axial or would you just use an orthogonal projection?
    <br><br>
    <b>Elly Martin:</b> yeah that's a good question I think probably if I was doing that, then I would take the line along that axis, if that was the beam axis as it were, then I might take the lines along and across that.
    <br><br>
    <b>Keith Murphy:</b> So you would go to the peak of this focus and then you draw an orthogonal to that from there also?
    <br><br>
    <b>Elly Martin:</b> I guess this is when this thing starts to get slightly more complicated, I guess. Because maybe what you do in that case is you'd have to do some probably more complicated measurement to find the angle of the state focus and the size of it and things like that. But yeah, you could do that if that's what you want to know what the kind of axial and natural extents are, then that's what I would recommend.
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> I'm considering future-proofing this idea. Even if there are whole helmet solutions or
    if you don't know you're steering beforehand you would measure your field. In those cases, are you going to measure the longest axis and the one orthogonal to it? Right? Regardless of your steering?
    <br><br>
    <b>Elly Martin:</b> I think that's why it does start to become a bit more complicated if you do have
    steering and aberration correction. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> or would we say that if you cannot principally define the actual length or actual direction then please provide a plot? So, at least people specify it rather than throwing the towel in the ring.
    <br><br>
    <b>Elly Martin </b> Yeah you might be right that not every single thing will fit neatly into this table. And it might be that you what you've sort of end up saying is that okay we've done this um planning simulation for this huge array in this person and we expect that we get a focus of this size and that's what you report but the whole thing might really be done in simulation. But then you may also report some free field measurements that you've done, but it's unlikely you'd measure that under every single steering possibility. So yeah, that's a good point to think about.
    <br><br>
    <b>Mark Schafer:</b> I had a conversation with some folks at the FDA last week about a system that involved a lot of potential parameters ‘how would you measure them all’, and their basic answer was: ‘measure the straightforward stuff and then provide simulation data because you can't be expected to measure every potential beam steering angle and focus condition’. So they felt comfortable with good measurements of a well-defined situation and then simulations to account for the others. Just thought of how we would consider it here as well.
    <br><br>
    <b>Elly Martin:</b> I think that will be our approach that we will show that we can stay to positions that we want to stay to and then show that measurements agree with simulations so that we've proven that bit and then say okay now we think our simulations are accurate and for all the other cases as well. 
      I mean I think for a lot of the studies that are taking place at the moment with quite simple transducers with only a few elements this kind of thing will work pretty well but yeah I agree mainly.  Perhaps the quantities will be the same but the way that they're in will be slightly different for these more complicated multi-element arrays.
    <br><br>
    <b>Keith Murphy:</b> so are you going to describe that in this document earlier or maybe update it? It sounds like you guys might not have gotten to that yet. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Elly Martin:</b> We hadn't really kind of discussed those sorts of systems a lot in this document. So, we'll have a think about what we need to include on that.
    <br><br>
    <b>Samuel Pichardo:</b> yeah I'm surprised that you didn't include XXX from the certitude model dimensions in the table. So many people reporting that and you're right so much.
    <br><br>
    <b>Elly Martin:</b> The document describes that if you do make your own measurements then you should describe how you did those, but we're not making the assumption that everyone is making their own measurements, so this is more about how you report the numbers that you do have rather than the methods that you want to get them, if that makes sense. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Samuel Pichardo:</b> The reality is that there are going to be many uses especially in Neuroscience where they only buy a machine and they want to have the capability, they want to really rely on their little documentation manufacturers are providing. That’s the reality. So maybe it would be something that this information, this level of reporting, needs to reach manufacturers. So, they can report well this what my vendor told me on how my transducer is supposed to work.
    <br><br>
    <b>Elly Martin:</b> I think that's exactly what we'd like the manufacturers to do.
    <br><br>

    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> The second section here is just on the pulse timing parameters which is kind of a short section I think. it's relatively short. There's a figure here that has definitions: a pulse, a pulse duration, a post-repetition interval, and then there's a pulse train potentially and then that would have a pulse train duration. Of course, that can get repeated. So given that it could get repeated many times we thought maybe it would be best if people would use a table structure so you would have your post duration, your pulse ramp duration, your pulse ramp shape, and then your post repetition interval, and that can get repeated. Then you can just keep on with multiple lines of the table as many times as you need to.
      So, we thought that we would actually include some additional examples so here's one where there were many repetitions, at different levels of repetitions. So that was just kind of an example of using many sorts of nested post trains and how it would be clearest we thought to report that. 
      Here's another example where, in this paper, there was a comparison of two different types of pulse trains, and so having a different section of the table where this description of each of those goes. And then of course, if you're going to go from one to another, the time between experiments, so there's a place here for notes as well. 
      Then there's an example here where there was ramping used. Here they used three and a quarter millisecond pulse duration and that pulse duration includes the wraps, and then out of that there was one millisecond for ramp up and a millisecond per ramp down, and then to specify the ramp shape and it was a two-key window on the pressure.
    <br><br>
    That’s about it. There are some other little bits and pieces in the document but let me just pause there and see if there are any questions about the timing part before we move on to the derived parameters.
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> I'm wondering if you can always derive the (e.g.,) total energy if you know these… so yeah, you basically need to make sure that the ramp shape is sufficient so that you can always describe the calculated total energy, for example.
    <br><br>
    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> I’m surprised nobody wants to talk about the term burst. This is personally, I find it very confusing ‘what does burst mean?’. so I just kind of feel like you know maybe we shouldn’t just use the word burst because it's so confusing…
    <br><br>
    <b>Mark Schafer:</b> I think the document said this is the way we'd want to do it I mean it is confusing because this is unlike what's done in diagnostic where a pulse is usually one, and a burst is many. But I think given you've laid out a very internally coherent structure I think we should just go with it and avoid that confusion within this community.
    <br><br>
    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> I mean I guess one of our arching themes was that we wanted to conform as much as possible with diagnostic ultrasound, well there are definitely places where things are different, so we have to start to diverge from them, but that was one where maybe we could try to be similar. 
    <br><br>
    <b>via chat Benjamin Kop:</b> says “should we use pulse repetition period or do you recommend pulse repetition interval”
    <br><br>
    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> It is really the same thing.. so I guess that's a good question do we all use the same terminology?
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> In some fields, interval is reserved for the period where there is no stimulation. So the time in between the end of one pulse and the start of the next pulse.
    <br><br>
    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> Okay you would prefer pulse repetition period then?
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> I was wondering.. but again periods strongly suggest that it is always the same time.. But just to highlight if people use interval, then they should specify it. So in cognitive neuroscience there's
    something like an inter-trial interval which is the time between the end and the start of the next one that's why you say inter-trial. 
      For me, I think that maybe that is where our potential confusion could come from but we are here to decide if it is a blue confusion an interval uh 
    <br><br>
    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> I'm happy with period. Period means something to me that conforms to that so I'd be happy with that.
    <br><br>
    <b>Charles Caskey:</b> well, I don't have a question I just know that PRP is used for Pretty Fractional Pressure often in ultrasound if we're trying to avoid that are used in both fields. This would be PRP if we decided on post repetition period.
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> but Charles you actually make a very good point. If we refer to pulse repetition interval, then that is about the pulse repetition and if we specifically want to address the intermediate pairs we would say inter-pulse interval. I think we can dissociate between these two by being explicit, right?
    <br><br>
    <b>Charles Caskey:</b> the way you were describing it, it didn't sound that way. But yeah the inter-trial interval, it kind of seems like that interval is used to just more generally so yeah I do think that all 
    <br><br>
    <b>Miriam Klein-Flügge:</b> I agree with what you (Lennart) said that as long as it's clear what interval we're measuring I think, interval will work fine. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Yoshikazu Ugawa:</b> in TMS terminology we usually use pulse as the most shortest one so
    pulse interval is the small pulses interval and burst is one group of these is the one interversed interval and trial usually is used in some experiment or one trial and again the two minutes rate another trial so the meaning of trial is a bit different. But our terminal is not always consistent with the TMS but you
    should determine what terminology you use.
      But, I don't understand what pulse interval repetition rate or reputational rate means maybe in the
    burst interval is a reverse of the maybe rate. So anyway so please define what your terminology and always use the same term knowledge.
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> I think this is a really important point and because here we have a convergence of multiple fields and often many hierarchically nested organizational levels, right? What's referred to as train level one, two, three, allows you to be completely flexible. 
      I think there's a very important aspect of the table that I like lots is the ‘notes section’ namely if we would all standardize our reporting in this way we can be fully flexible and everybody can still
    describe in the notes this level, “I refer to as the pulse, the burst, the trial, the run, the session, the day”. So everybody uses many of those different levels and that actually means that you can use your terminology in your paper that fits with your field but everybody can always go back to these tables and have the exact same comparisons across different papers and I think I would like that very much. I would encourage everybody to use the notes here in this table to describe the terminology as they also use it in their field and to connect with other maybe even earlier papers.
    <br><br>
    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> So we definitely think of this as a time when people can provide feedback so I want to encourage people to send us an email with your thoughts and let's have some discussion about it. And as Lennart suggested we'll come back in a couple of months, hopefully with a more finished product, but please do send your comments and suggestions, and let's kind of hammer it out now so that everybody's kind of reasonably happy about it. I think in the interest of time now that you've seen the timing part let's move on to the next section, which is the derived parameters.
    <br><br>
    So in the document we have gone through the sort of definitions and a lot of text and one thing in another but I think it sort of all comes together in the tables again. So the next section is the derating and derived parameters. Now that being said there's two sections here, like two alternative sets of tables. So the first set of tables, I'm going to describe here when there's no subject-specific information and then the second is when you do have subject-specific information and you've done simulation. So, two different kinds of mindsets. 
    <br><br>
    If you don't have any subject-specific information, what can you say about the beam? Well, if we specify what's the beam diameter on the equipment the scalp the skull and the brain and we have some derating values for each of those potentially and some thickness, then we can get to some attenuation factors for each of those. Then we can come up with a total attenuation factor or total D-rating. Then once we have that, we can take the pressure field that we had specified up above and apply that to now have our D-rated spatial peak pressure. So there's different ways you can come up with these numbers: you could type some in, maybe there's some default values that we could use in here if we don't have any subject specific information. For example, I've sort of filled in here some information on the about the skull given by the work of Jean Francois that many us have been working on. to kind of say what do we think is a reasonable derating in the absence of any information and so that I have sort of plugged in here. For the skull it's again sort of a minimal attenuation because we have to assume that it's a thin skull with minimal attenuation if we don't have any additional information. Okay so falling out from some assumptions of what you do there then you'd have a d-rated spatial peak pressure that could give you a calculation of your MI. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Elly Martin:</b> So, there's a new version of this standard which is still being drafted at the moment that talks about these mechanical and thermal entities and how they're defined. What will be added to that is an MIapp quantity. The normal MI that's used on diagnostic cultures and transducers has a specific attenuation coefficient that's used for the derating of the pressure to do the calculation. This new MIapp basically allows for use of different attenuation coefficients to get a better estimate when you've got a different tissue path, that's not normal soft tissue. So, I think the idea is that basically you do the same calculation that just enables you to specify what attenuation coefficient you did use. Which is going to be much more applicable in this case. So if you if you're choosing an attenuation coefficient of skull scalp brain or something like that, that's not this kind of standard value then you're not calculating the MI as it's officially defined, so you're calculating this other one. You just need to specify how you did that.
       But yeah that standard has not been published yet but it's under discussion and draft at the moment so it seems like it would be good to be applied in this situation 
    <br><br>
    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> People should report the acoustic impedance they use, then out of that you can get the derated Isppa and then the TIC. So this would come from the acoustic output power up here, that field, and then that comes here. This is a derived parameter. 
    <br><br>
    Okay that's how we were thinking about what you might report in the absence of any subject-specific information and simulation and then there would be a different version of tables if you do have that. So, this is again you just have to report your acoustic impedance and then the TIC potentially would come here but then you might put in here for your simulated spatial peak pressure. So now, we have two different tables for it, there's one table for the spatial peak and one for the target because those may not be the same. At least, if they're not the same then it makes sense to report both because you want to be able to report what's at your target but also the spatial peak because the spatial peak is for the safety aspect. 
    <br><br>
    One of the things I would also say is that we've had a lot of discussions about sort of what is the minimum reporting versus the suggested bigger set of reporting. For us the absolute minimum reporting is the free field measurements as well as the timing. And then in many ways the derived parameters are sort of additional reporting but then this is a minimal set of additional reporting. So, it's entirely possible there's lots more things that people want to report and that's great, the more reporting the better, but we did want to just lay out a structure for some sort of minimal reporting.
    <br><br>
    <b>Martin Monti:</b> Do you envision this being that we all download an Excel sheet from the group publishes as recommendations and then we all upload that as an appendix to our papers or do you envision this just as how we obtain the information that when we described in the manuscript?
    <br><br>
    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> I'm going to throw that back to you all.
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Why not both? I would very much like to see that the very minimal reporting papers for example what comes out directly out of the free field measurements or what your machine is doing should be included in the paper. So that if you download a paper all the information is there and you don't need to go look for supplementary materials. So I think that would be helpful for these very minimal sets that you've described Kim. But what I would love is that this could be an Excel sheet as it could be a simple form on the ITRUSST website where you fill in your parameters and you get a PDF out. And that people can then still include for supplementing materials to have the full set and then they're automatically exactly in the standardized reporting format and points as we would like to see them.
    <br><br>
    <b>Martin Monti:</b> That sounds like a great idea. It might also make it very easy if there were an online ways of steering that might make it easy for us and for anybody else who's interested at looking across studies at parameters and how they might affect things.
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> I think that's a great idea
    <br><br>
    <b>In chat:</b> “what about different TI values basically?”
    <br><br>
    <b>Mark Schafer:</b> yeah when we did the TIC originally back in the day, we looked at all the cases: scanning, non-scanning, where the focus were, where things were and the particular case of transcranial, the bone at surface really did predominate all the other heating issues.
    <br><br>
    <b>Samuel Pichardo:</b> But that can’t be true for the small operating transducers. I would have the tendency to disagree. For larger operating transducers you may some conditions that you would have much more healing on the skull might be relevant especially for these low intensities conditions. So you might want to keep an eye on the heating so much, you can achieve. 
      Because back in the day it was not really including all this, how transducers will operate in for example ring configurations, many things that were not fully considered. It's not really so black and white 
    <br><br>
    <b>Mark Schafer:</b> well certainly if you're doing your simulations and you find a pre-focal heating that's clearly very important. I guess the question is there's no TI xxx formula straightforward that says it'll account for that. If you're doing your simulations obviously if you get the bio heat equation running in three-dimensionals and you've found out something going on, so certainly that should be reported. But in terms of saying we calculate the existing TIS or the existing TIB for your geometry it's better to say TIC is probably your worst case but if you suspect because of your geometry there may be something going on make a recommendation to do a simulation. Because Samuel you're exactly right. Because you do off axis beam steering and you've got a side lobe that comes up where you don't expect it, and it could have other heating consequences. So, I'm in agreement with yes in complicated situations you're absolutely right. The question is how do you simplify that down to say calculate from the manual, Because you know TIC is one equation TIS has a certain equation.
    <br><br>
    <b>Elly Martin:</b> what's in this table is a kind of minimum reporting thing, so that you can use TIC to give you an indication of what the temperature rise might be when you haven't measured it or simulated it. It kind of assumes that the energy from your transducer, which takes into account the diameter of the transducer, is absorbed in the skull and causes heating if you've simulated the temperature that's obviously much more rigorous, so just report what the temperature rises are, they're not an index then they're just to temperature rise. It’s the maximum temperature it's not an index. 
    I guess you might add an extra line or a few rows to one of these tables that says you know this is the position of my temperature rise and this is what it is.
    <br><br>
    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> yeah, then you'd have to specify where that is. I mean it's not necessarily the spatial peak it could be at the skull.
    <br><br>
    <b>Samuel Pichardo:</b> my plan was to report the maximum in the three regions. This is the maximum location to the skin, this is the maximum location on the skull, and the maximum location from out the brains, so that you can report that.
    <br><br>
    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> Do you think the temperature rise at the target as well or just at the spatial Peak?
    <br><br>
    <b>Samuel Pichardo & Elly Martin: basically both agree. Yeah I mean again I think if you've done the simulations and you have all the information then you can report these things.
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> I think it would be helpful if we specify that thermal parameters relevant for thermal safety would be desired to reproduce, right? Otherwise people might feel that it's completely free. But now we're saying it's up to you whether you choose the max temperature rise or the TIC and the other one was the thermal dose in the cumulative equivalent minutes. So, is any of those three neede? 
      All of them is what you can do but then I feel that at least here sometimes reporting we're saying you should report parameters that are relevant to assess the thermal safety.
    <br><br>
    <b>Mark Schafer:</b> TIC is your minimum but if we have all the other acoustic parameters as being required. One could in theory then say well what was the potential thermal for that once you have all the beam information from the first section. 
      TIC is just a quick shorthand to say where am I on the scale of potential and rather than anything as big details what Sam's talking about. But if we have all that acoustic information then one could do a calculation to do a comparison at the focal region.
    <br><br>
    <b>Keith Murphy:</b> If this has like a PDF print out, maybe you guys can add like a recommended table of thermal simulation parameters like absorption coefficients and perfusion metrics and things like that?
    <br><br>
    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> Elly you have a section discussing simulations. You had some thoughts about this?
    <br><br>
    <b>Elly Martin:</b> So at the moment there's an appendix which talks in more detail about how you make measurements. We didn't add the same thing yet to discuss how to do simulations but we could add that or refer to some existing references perhaps.
    <br><br>
    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> Yeah so that I guess is how much into the details of simulations do we want this to be, this document, versus assuming that that's covered elsewhere and this is like once you've done the simulations what do we need to report.
    <br><br>
    <b>Keith Murphy:</b> I don't think you can assume that because then you're just gonna have two different values and you're not gonna know why they're different. I think that should be listed in here though. Maybe you could also like cite the paper or something but then there's little missed values and things.
    <br><br>
    <b>Elly Martin:</b> I mean we could add a section that just talks about what you should report about.. well there are already references and guidance on how to report simulations: so what quantities you should report but yeah. I guess the point of this document is not to tell you how to do those simulations and we point to other references as to how to report them, I guess. Then we're asking for these numbers but then there are other documents, which tell you what like parameters of the simulations you should write down is that is that what you mean.
    <br><br>
    <b>Keith Murphy:</b>  I mean it's okay to point to something outside but then you're losing a little bit. You guys are aggregating things that people have already defined so that you can read it in a single sheet and compare apples to apples. I don't think it's that many items to add. I mean if you even look at like the K-wave examples and just pull the parameter set and you're gonna have a recommended set or people can pull whatever from that and just stick it in here.
    <br><br>
    <b>Elly Martin:</b> do you mean like actual values to what thermal conductivity you should use for the brain or that kind of thing?
    <br><br>
    <b>Keith Murphy:</b> yeah. I mean maybe I'm sort of speaking out of turn on this but I'm like if I were telling someone what my thermal rise were, I might have used a different blood perfusion coefficient for the whole brain than say Kim did and then that'll change everything right? So then are studies comparable or did we just use different values and if I just start referring to references nobody's going to go read them and then well... 
    <br><br>
    <b>Elly Martin:</b> I mean I think you should write down in that case. You should say this is the value I calculated and I calculated it using, this is my thermal and acoustic parameters. I just don't know if we need to define here what they should pick.
    <br><br>
    <b>Keith Murphy:</b> well maybe if you have just a few basic ones again because then we can save this document and say we adhere to all these recommended things. I mean if you start leaving things out that are critical then we're just referring to a bunch of different things and it gets a little messy again. it's just a suggestion.
    <br><br>
    <b>Elly Martin:</b> Okay, we'll have some discussions on that yeah. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> So, I guess that's all that we have prepared and again I wanted to reiterate that this is a period where we can have lots of discussions and make sure we put in to hear what people think is right and want to see so please do send us your comments! Yeah so, I guess that's it from us Lennart.
    <br><br>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen: Elly, Kim, this is absolutely fantastic very wonderful um people please keep your comments coming and we're looking forward to a next iteration.
    <br><br>
