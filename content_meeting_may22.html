<h3>Agenda</h3>
<ul>
    <li>-   The practice working group will discuss their work to establish a best-practice guide</li>
</ul> 

<div  class="block blockgrey">
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        Til Ole Bergmann first shared updates regarding FUN22. There was an open call to invite and inform colleagues in the field who are not part of the ITRUSST network about FUN22. Til then presented the draft how-to study guide written by the practice group. This document, which is desired to have it in a live format, is intended for non-experts who want to start their ultrasound lab. After going through the sections, discussion points came up such as whether the sections contain all the content and are worded in the right tone.

<h3>Meeting proceedings</h3>
<p>

    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> I just asked if there's any announcements. Til, do you have any announcements or things you'd like to say about the FUN22 conferenc?<br><br>

    <b>Til Ole Bergmann:</b>  Yes, the FUN22 conference’s extra submission is open now since beginning of May. We had an initial email to the ITRUSST mailing list, so hopefully already targeting the core audience. We also managed to have an email sent to the attendees of the last two FUN meetings and I also emailed a bunch of colleagues. I was hoping that also maybe all of you could then invite and inform your colleagues who might be from the field but not in in the network of ITRUSST or even for different people interested in getting into this. We're going to post by different channels, there have been tweets already. <br><br>
                              We had planned to close the abstract submission end of May to have a month for abstract reviewing and then provide feedback end of June so that the participants could then book their travels after getting confirmation of acceptance of the abstracts. I now think that maybe we should extend abstract deadline by let's say two weeks. Since most people submit close to the deadline as we know, we've received much yet but that was expected then this is independent from the actual registrations which are not open yet and still requires some things to be finalised on the IT side. We also expect a much larger number of attendees than of contributors because this is a growing future rapidly growing field and I know that many people are interested in joining, I know of a lot of colleagues with without having anything to contribute yet. So I think even if we don't get a huge number of abstracts, which I hope we still do, we should be concerned about the number of participants. We hope that we can open the registration actually in June. For submitting, the information you need is on the website fun22.org or on twitter. <br><br> For the scientific committee, I’m going to write another doodle so that we can decide on the abstract submission deadline extension which is a common thing to do. I think that's that's for now.

    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> Okay that's great thank you Til. Are there any announcements on anything else before we go to our presentation today from the practice group? *no reply* Then I hand it back to Til to tell us what the practice group has been up to. <br><br>

    <b>Til Ole Bergmann:</b> This is the practice working group *shows academic and industry members*. Keith has provided a lot of expertise on the ultrasound physics and transducer design also on animal models. Tulika has merged sections bringing information with fMRI and EEG  Takahiro also is part of the hardcore working on writing sections, also lots on the equipment. Sven has very helpful comments writing sections we consider for the discussions and targeting. Apoutou was very helpful with modelling. Anton provided lots of improvement on the combination with TMS and gel and coupling pads. Benjamin provided input on ethics and certification parameters and good discussion about the principal structure of the entire document. Andrew from Brainbox was always providing good and important information. We’re happy to include more industry. So that’s our group that actively works on this document. <br><br>

    This document is a practical guide for beginners. The guide will be provided as open access document (PDF) on the ITRUSST website. I’m interested in getting your input about other possibilities of integrating this into the knowledge base of ITRUSST. Importantly, this guide should be a living document, it should be regularly updated when practices change and get more insights how to best tackle certain problems and how to solve certain technical and practical issues. The idea is that this guide should be accompanied by a disucsssion forum. It would be something that maybe in collaboration with the open working group providing an opportunity for researchers to discuss methods. <br><br>

    So I would like to pitch you the idea that we would have a discussion forum. A good advice is actually stored and accessible to others so that it’s a growing database and that you can extract information from the new ideas. So before you want to start your ultrasound, we also want to have a publication outlet, so we would publish not the entire guide, as a scientific journal might not be necessary, but to have methods section together. The second reason is that it’s going to be dynamic, for example an toolbox in which one could publish a letter to the editor of brain simulation where we refer to this document in this project. The associated discussion forum can be helpful for people starting with their first ultrasound for neural modulation. <br><br>

    The next step is to finalise the first draft. We would like to ask the ITRUSST members for input and comments because we’re only a very small group and the practical experience of the community should eventually go into this document. We’re going to add more didactic figures, I think some of the concepts would benefit from more figures. We might even add videos, so we could show certain procedures especially, for example how we get the gel onto the scalp while avoiding air bubbles. Then the next question is whether the guide will be like an isolated solution or whether we can put this up as a general platform on the ITRUSST website where discussion happen. We could also for example use it in the context of the FUN conference so we prevent a similar solution for the discussion of poster presentations that are online. So if we would like to have this, this ITRUSST forum could be place to discuss documents but also where discussion can take place for conferences, etc. and then eventually publish this to increase the visibility of the guide and ITRUSST in general. <br><br>

    Here is the early version of the guide, it’s still work in progress. We’re still debating heavily on the order of some sections and what to integrate where it’s not finished. We have an introduction, with a brief intro the fundamentals of the basics of artisan physics and definition communication parameters to set a basic knowledge. Then we have a section about the equipment about how ultrasound systems are composed, how transducers are designed, coupling media and systems, calibration equipment, what specific equipment you need when you combine those with MRI or TMS for example. Also a section about control software, new navigation systems, MRI and CT imaging on adversity modelling software, including numerical modelling. The core audience here is a new user from the general new science field, maybe having experience with other non-invasive stimulation methods. We’re touching on each topic but we keep it relatively shallow so that you can easily digest it and we provide resources for further reading including the outputs of the separate groups, so only at an introductory level. It’s a section you might want to look into when you are about to or interested in setting up your own ultrasound lab so that you know what you need to buy but maybe not immediately and what should drive your decisions.  The next section is about the actual procedures, split into an academic paper and a paper where you have the materials and methods. This section is not finalised yet, but it’s a general introduction to the online and offline approaches, confounding factors, counter measures, control conditions, and application planning. This section provides what is the least thing that you need to do, what gives a bit more accuracy, and what is the gold standard that we would recommend. We tried to describe the different solutions and also what we would recommend. Thanks to Keith there is actual a section on animal model studies, again it’s not meant to replicate everything we’ve discussed before in animals, but to give people an idea what is needed for doing translational studies and those that would like to have tiered approach. We also have a section on ethics, I could consider actually moving this somewhere as a part of the procedure to apply for ethics but then it’s so different for each side and we don’t want to get into long discussions of the ethical and safety issues. Additionally, relationships between frequency and focus size absorption are explained in a table. For the equipment we try to describe it as generic as possible but also as inclusive as possible when it comes to different manufacturers. Then we talk about coupling media and systems, different gel pads, water bladder coupling, the calibration equipment, acoustic modelling, numerical modelling, We’re going to link to documents from the equipment group. Maybe we move acoustic and numerical modelling to the supplement to make sure that it is easily understandable by a reader that comes from a very different background, but we also want to provide some reading to understand a bit more detail. Then we discuss the use of new navigation systems, the point is just that with the navigation system MR-based stereotactic frames new navigation, but it doesn’t mean that you are going to have your focus on the desired location, or that you are actually stimulating the neurons in the way you desired. Here, the neurotic engagement is important conceptual distinction. Again, in the procedures the experimental design will introduce confounding factors like the auditory sound and sensations such as heating of the skin, and how to deal with them with control conditions. Then the application planning, so what you need to do in specific order of thigns if you want to do a specific experiment. We’re not going to give advice like you have to use that protocol or this protocol, because this is too early to tell; there is no consensus so we try to reference literature but not give advice what to do. This would be a bit too dangerous for us at the moment, but the general recommendations is to start if you knew already published and safely applied protocols and then go from there. <br><br>

    That’s basically the guide. I’m very grateful to all the contributions from the group members, and we’ll give a final touch to the structure. We’d like to ask for input by directly commenting in the Google Document.<br><br>

    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> Thank you so much, it’s very impressive, very comprehensive. I want to thank the whole team as well. There are some questions for you in the chat. <br><br>

    <b>Bradley Treeby (chat): Have you thought about a wiki or Github pages?<br><br>

    <b>Til Ole Bergmann:</b> We have definitely discussed the wiki which is the other possibility which would mean move all the content from the document into a wiki. My experience with wikitemps is that there are quite often not a lot of active contributions because there complicated. We would like to have still a book character that you can just download, read in bed, or refer to it. The idea was to have a curated information transfer from like the forum wherever everyone can contribute into the guide by moderators, also kind of quality insurance, so that not everyone is editing. When a lot of people are working freely on a wiki, it could also easily becomes a very chaotic thing where you could dive into a rabbit hole following a lot of links, with some very shallow low depth in four paragraphs and then like 20 pages on a certain topic. So, we’ll test it there but we definitely discuss them and I’m still open to the option. <br><br>

    <b>Bradley Treeby (chat):</b> How do you plan to maintain consistency between what you’ve written here and the other groups that we’ve been talking about safety and planning groups etc. <br><br>

    <b>Til Ole Bergmann:</b> That’s a good point. That’s part of keeping it a live documentary which means unlike a publication that you just put out there once and then forget about it. It’s going to be an effort to keep it up to date which would mean that the practice group after this first part of work is done and we’re still here. We would read the input from the output from the other groups and try to incorporate updated sections but always linking to the in-depth expert output of the groups but providing in this document an easy to digest introductory content. In the other direction, we’d also rely on the experts from the other group that will flag inconsistencies. We need to go in both directions. <br><br>

    <b>Samuel Pichardo: Til, congrulations to you and the rest of the team. Thanks a lot for such a hard work. Would you describe the integration between the treatment planning some neuro navigation some acoustic modellers? Lot of that information will be very important to try to capture for example if you’re reorienting your transducer, especially with handheld devices, the orientations in real time change, so we can provide the real-time acoustic simulations. Right now it’s difficult to realign the transducer as a way to simulation. The misalignment between the acoustic simulations and during the procedure can become a problem  especially for subcortical targets. <br><br>

    <b>Til Ole Bergmann:</b> I think it’s very critical and what we’re going to point out in the document is allocations, that in an individual models it’s the key; to have a good idea about where and what type your shape, your location focus has, what intensity for a specific transducer position, etc. As it is either you basically want to have the inverse solutions solved and you want to know where to put the transducers and how to steer it for a certain target or you want to have if possible like real-time information about where the focus is while you move the transducer around on the head. I think this is a question for the planning group. For the practical guide, we can only mention these issues in the conceptual problems, but at the moment we wouldn’t advise for one particular solution.<br><br>

    <b>Ellen Bubrick:</b> That was excellent and congratulations again on the work. I just wanted to ask a little bit about the target verification section because to me that’s the least evidence-based, at least in humans. Many of us are working hard on it but it’s definitely not there yet and  I wouldn’t want to make it sound like that’s a great way to confirm target verification. <br><br>

    <b>Til Ole Bergmann:</b> What we want to make sure is that we are clearly making the distinction between target exposure of verification or validation of target exposure. The target exposure can maybe hopefully soon be meditated with RFI for example, it’s on the right spot but new target engagement I think is also critical. So at some point you need an outcome variable and this may be behaviour or a clinical scale. If it has the effect that it should have clinically you could say ‘that’s fine’. It’s efficient for certain applications but if you want to make the claim that you claim that you actually increase or decrease spontaneous activity or excitability of a target structure, you need to somehow provide evidence for that. In humans, we have only the non-invasive methods available typically, unless you have some intracranial coins possibility which we should mention actually. That’s a good addition.<br><br>
    
    <b>Ellen Bubrick:</b> I would be very careful with how that part is worded. That these are just ideas people can think about fun things to try, but a guide implies that there’s some scientific merit. I just don’t think you’re there yet in target engagement.<br><br> 

    <b>Til Ole Bergmann:</b> I totally agree, in this guide it’s not supposed to be guidelines. If guide implies this, we should think about another name but it’s really an introduction into the topic for beginners and it should guide you in starting an ultrasound lab. <br><br>

    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> Yes, maybe more like a how-to study guide.<br><br>

    <b>Yoshikazu Ugawa:</b> I only have one question: you mentioned about the sham stimulation, exclude some non-specific effect not really the brain effect – so what is the best way to jump to exclude other possibilities to how to do some stimulations? Some sentences may be needed to for this part<br><br>

    <b>Til Ole Bergmann:</b> Yes I agree, so I think that we do have at the moment only a small paragraph on sham in the section on control conditions. We could definitely increase that into an extra subsection goes a bit more into details describing the different methods of like flip transducer, shielded transducer, different non-effective protocols. But there’s definitely no consensus in what is a good sham that is actually mimicking the auditory and sense. An active control may be even the strongest control in brain stimulation studies compared to sham conditions. So a few more explanations may be needed.<br><br>

    <b>Mark Schafer:</b> Something you may want to consider is that one of my student presented on a sham gel pad a double-blind gel pad that she developed that allowed for transmitter non-transmit in a way that’s blinded into both the experimenter and the operator<br><br>

    <b>Til Ole Bergmann:</b> I’m already convinced that we should increase the sham section and discuss all these approaches. It’s good if you just read in this guide of the different possibilities that there are maybe known pros and cons and then you can make selection based on that inform precision. So that section is going to be extended. <br><br>

                             This is exactly the kind of feedback I’m also looking forward to when we give the guide to read and then you can put in all those comments. The idea is that this to a certain degree at least reflecting the consensus on practical advice from the ITRUSST community. We provide the first draft and instruction, then we rely on your input to extend it and to make sure that we have no blind spots.<br><br>

    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> Thank you so much Til, the whole team, this is just really a very impressive effect. Don’t forget to look for your emails about FUN22 and abstract deadline etc. Thank you all.<br><br>
