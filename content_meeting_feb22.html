<h3>Agenda</h3>
<ul>
    <li>-    Plans for FUN22</li>
    <li>-    Update model intercomparison project https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.04552.pdf2</li>
</ul> 

<div  class="block blockgrey">
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        FUN22 will be happening on 26-28 September in Mainz, Germany. The local organisation team would like to facilitate informal exchange, networking, and collaborations which works best in in-person conference, however at the same time we want to maximize both the impulsivity and accessibility. Matters such as possibilities and challenges when doing hybrid conference, differences in time zones, the fees for on-site and remote attendees were discussed. 
        After the FUN22 update,  the planning group shared their update regarding phase 1 in which they defined numerical benchmarks and performed intercomparison with different models. There, they concluded that across the 11 models there's a good agreement. The median differences across the nine benchmarks and eleven models were less than 10% difference in the peak pressure and less than 1 millimetre in the position of the focus. Next steps of the planning group are repeating the same exercise with elastic wave models (phase 2) and defining a new set of benchmarks with properties mapped from CT images (phase 3).

<h3>Meeting proceedings</h3>
<p>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Hey people, we're here at a plenary session of ITRUSST and thanks for joining us. On today's agenda we have two topics: first we have a discussion on FUN22 and this discussion will be led by by Til who announced some of the current plans and where we would like to ask for your input. Second we'll have an update from Brad on result of a modeling inter comparison and the first benchmarks of their publication.<br> Are there any other general plenary topics you would like to address before we get started? – no reply – Please Til, the floor is yours.<br><br>
</p>

    <h3>Update focus groups or FUN 22</h3>
<p>    
    <b>Til Ole Bergmann::</b> First of all thanks to my team here for providing many of these slides. So we had a long thought about when this conference is going to happen, discussed it also with Lennart and Kim for example. So there's no perfect time of course but September 26 to 28 is a time where there's no lecturing activity on the on the campus and this is why we can actually get one of the building.<br><br>
                              It's going to happen in Mainz and you might wonder where is Mainz; it's Germany and it's close to Frankfurt. It’s a place worth visiting and it's also pretty easy to get here because it's very close to Frankfurt international airport which you can reach from anywhere in the in the world easily and you just have to take a local train for 20 minutes and then you are at Mainz main station. .<br><br>
                              We were lucky to get one of the last spots in the building called the old Mensa and it has space for normal conditions almost up to 300 people but with the epidemic conditions I think we need to cap it at roughly 100 participants on site and a second room for posters. The nice thing is that there is also the bar restaurant in the same building called the Baron. They will provide the coffee catering, light lunch catering, and depending on the schedule maybe doing student poster session or so. For the dinner it is a bit too small depending on the number of actual participants on site; we are most likely going to a place somewhere either at the riverside or in the old city centre.<br><br>
                              After this teaser; what are the goals right of the FUN22. The main goal of the conferences is of course to present and discuss the latest research in the technical developments in TUS. We'll have a couple of different formats including talks, poster presentations, panel discussions, and something we also may be hands-on training. We would like to facilitate informal exchange, networking, and collaborations which works best in in-person conference.<br><br>
                              Now at the same time we want to maximize both the impulsivity and accessibility which means we try to keep participation fees low approximately might be like 50 euro for the virtual attendants in 200 with on-site participation. It’s not fixed yet but according to our calculations going forward, this seems very realistic.<br><br>
                              I try to invite speakers at all career levels, virtually access without travels, not only in person conference and asynchronous time zone independent access to the materials.<br><br>
                              So obviously this calls for a hybrid meeting but in case of conflict of on-site and virtual conference, we would favour the on-site meeting because it turns out you can't have it all.  Hybridity is really difficult;
                              the first challenge are those time zone differences. The other problem is the interaction of onsite and room remote attendees right so it's easy to bring together on-site attendees normal conference FUN19.<br><br>
                              It is easier for plenary interactions so to establish true hybrid forms than for this one-on-one interactions
                              so let's have a look for the four scenarios for the talks:<br>
                              <ul>
                                <li>-   When we have a live talk on site with live Q&A answer session that's fine. If the attendees for this on-site talk are remote, still they can hear the live talk because it's recorded and live streamed and if they're in a different time zone they can um watch it later because it's going to be made before download. We can also stream it on site but I guess to prevent major technical problems we would have pre-recorded in that case but still have a live Q&A session.</li>
                                <li>-   If the presenter and attendee both being remote that's easy that's a normal zoom talk.</li>
                                <li>-   More difficult are the poster sessions. Again: easy on-site to present the poster and discuss, virtual worked fine with gathertown for FUN21. But if your virtual presenter is not on-site you could hang a pad next to the poster principle; you could have on-site avatar to remotely attend the on-site conference and both is technically feasible, but this cost about four and a half thousand dollars. So both these options are really difficult, higher equipment costs and also the noise level on site in the poster hall might totally prevent any reasonable communication with a remote presenter.</li>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>-   What we can do at least is make all courses available from on-site and remote attendees via gathertown. We can have pre-recorded two-minute poster pitches, but the posters are presented which can be viewed on demand but which we could also play during a perspective session on site. There's no perfect solution right now but we can discuss what is preferable.</li>
                                </ul>
                              </ul>
                          
                            The education program: enough effort was put into this last year and we might not need to reinvent the wheel completely with all the pre-recorded talks. What we can add is on-site hands-on tutorials for example a demonstration hands-on, plenary demo or small groups hands-on offered by other attendees or sponsors like k-wave. We have to discuss what is realistic.  We don't want to necessarily advertise a specific software or brand or a company but we would also want to facilitate the use of acoustic simulations and that needs practical training.<br><br>
                            *Shows possible schedules* -- So here we have the different time zones and this is the schedule in mind (centerd on European time zone) where everyone could easily join. I can move around these blocks; it's just to give an idea. It will be three days and we'll be starting it like nine o'clock until. Please let me know from the community what’s on your wish list? I'm happy to adjust everything based on on your feedback.<br><br>
                            So a lot remains to be done a bit beyond the local organization what we're already working on. 
                            We need a FUN22 website -- maybe we can get this under the ITRUSST domain. We need to form a representative and diverse organizing committees or scientific board for the conference. We need to decide on the general scientific program (possibly invited lectures), open the call for submissions gravity and select abstract nominate and select awards later contact sponsors manage registrations confirmations payments etc. So a lot to be done. So if you're interested in actively co-organizing, taking on certain tasks and helping; then let me know; then we can get an organizing committee beyond the local one in Mainz.<br><br>
                            That's basically it. I'm interested in input especially regarding this hybridity challenge<br><br>
    
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Let me get started to by thanking you for first volunteering to host and organize
                            this but second for that fantastic overview. They're lovely and no doubt FUN22 will be a fantastic symposium. I’m already looking forward to it. Then again, it's also my duty to alert everybody to the fact that I would prefer to have my face and name removed from the organizing committee.  I think actually ITRUSST and FUN22 would strongly benefit if I wouldn't be involved. I'm always happy to help out but I think a bit more rotation there would be beneficial for the quality.<br>
                            Let's open up a discussion. I'm really keen to hear from other people's perspectives and insights.<br><br>
                            
    <b>Til Ole Bergmann:</b> So in particular that the poster sessions are our biggest trouble because there is no solution that makes everyone happy.<br><br>
    
    <b>Andrew Thomas:</b> You mentioned on the pricing structure a reduced rate for the remote attendance which I think there should be a difference but maybe that that was quite a big difference in and I think it's almost to the point of ‘yes there's a lot of value in in attending but the value of the meeting is the content’. It's almost like we need to close the gap a little bit because you in essence what you don't want is to go to all the trouble of putting on a live even and then 90% of the people join us as a remote attendee anyway.<br><br>
    
    <b>Til Ole Bergmann:</b> That’s an interesting point, the difference is that if you remotely attend you don't need food <br><br>
    
    <b>Andrew Thomas:</b> Yeah but the problem there is you've still got to provide that for the people who are attending, if you run a hybrid you're committed to both and I think then you run the risk of if you want if you go all in person or all hybrid it's easier. We're coming off of two years of this thing where people are way more used to online this type of experience so it can be good and bad in equal measure because some people just can't wait to get back to in person conferences but likewise there are a surprisingly large amount of people who are quite happy to continue doing it this way as well so it's a hard thing to do yeah<br><br>
    
    <b>Til Ole Bergmann:</b> I'm not sure whether this is going to work with the fees because as an early career researcher usually your department pays, but it's if you have to pay off almost as much as a local attendee and you also expect a comparable experience right and to make cuts at some point that's okay
                            we cannot provide the same experience. There will be disadvantages of attending remotely and I think just paying a little less money is not going to to keep you from going there. So it depends on if the difference in
                            what you get for the money is also large. <br><br>
    
    <b>Andrew Thomas:</b> I think the thing we found it wasn't so much the registration fee of the conference itself it was the travel and accommodation that you need to pay for over and above whereas as opposed to 50 and that's what makes the 50 euros look even more attractive.br><br>
    
    <b>Seung Schik:</b> It all depends on the budget and if you have a good much money no need to so high price over attendance and 50 is good for Japanese agent because we may not go to Europe and 50 is a very good
                        amount of money. Usually international congress is more expensive, so say in some international congress of new world or something is 500 or more than 500 and it depends on the which hotel you
                        use and how much you sold 50 and 200. It’s not unfair for to my feeling and it depends on how much money you need.<br><br>
    
    <b>Andrew Thomas:</b> We ran a virtual meeting and there was a 90% favour towards doing it virtually. Even though you know people are eager to get back but maybe as I said we’re very much targeting our activities at people who haven't got budgets of their own to spend so maybe that's the difference here.<br><br>

    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> I think actually these discussions on the cost are very helpful but there is also underlying discussions on where we think our focus should be and what the general principles are for example in providing accessibility for people across the globe and accessibility for people who are slightly less privileged including financially or able to travel. But there were a few important topics also listed in the chat so I would like to give the floor to them.<br><br>

    <b>Seung Schik:</b> The time difference is quite important for Asian countries. Your election may be midnight in Japan and even we have a right to attempt in zoom but maybe we would like to sleep. So on site and the difference between these two methods make quite great impact on us but not great impact on European people.<br><br>

    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> I think actually you're highlighting something that we think we can improve from previous versions how global in fact our effort are and how accessible we are from people across many different places. But Til,l can I alert you to the fact that there were a few comments in the chat<br><br>

    <b>Til’s reply on the chat:</b> In case we do the second process session in the afternoon which is the case in one of the designs, I showed there would definitely be drinks associated and even says in the program already.
    
    <b>Chat:</b> It starts early morning and goes to the evening of those day. You might have the problem that there are too many people who want to attend in person anyway but if people don't have to spend those two extra nights essentially then that might broaden the reach of people who can afford to come.<br><br>

    <b>Til’s reply on the chat:</b> if you think that the two and a half days are sufficient and then of course we can stop like middle of the third day which would at least some people allow to leave that day arriving on the day of the conference. I think it's always tricky it would only work for neighbouring European countries anyway and even then. But it's true so we've thought about it and I guess we could just cut down a bit of talks a bit of poster and then one can leave a bit early on the last day. It depends on how much content we want. 

    <b>Reply:</b> I'd maybe more like have it more like a satellite like the day before because if you do it a week later I feel like people's energy has sapped and they moved on to do other things and it will be poorly attended but if it it's the day before say or day after then it's more tightly linked to the eating but would then maybe allow more people to interact with these the posters. <br><br>

    <b>Til Ole Bergmann:</b> So the day before is Sunday and also I thought well if it happens before and you saw all the posters online and then you go to the conference and you've seen all the content; it's a bit of a downer so even afterwards I think it's nice if it's the day after I was just afraid that a lot of people are still traveling and they know that some have to actually jump into the plane on the last day and go to a conference in Vancouver for and then it might again be difficult to attend one week later. <br><br>

    <b>Reply:</b> For me the next day or so it would also be fine.<br><br>

      <b>Til Ole Bergmann:</b> Any other opinions on the satellite idea whether before or after; so instead of trying to do the virtual poster sessions during these three or two and a half days. Would anyone favour having a virtual poster session while the online conference is running? – I take that as a no.<br><br>

      <b>Keith Murphy:</b> I think if you go too hard on this whole virtual thing you know that's coming from somewhere, like you don't have infinite bandwidth to make this thing awesome. I would really give up on the virtual -- not entirely but like don't fight for it if you can avoid that. Andrew might be right though if there's 90% in this virtual thing that that would be a problem so maybe really try to dissuade that from happening.<br><br>

      <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Thanks everybody for these discussions. Til, did you get out what you were looking for? <br><br>

      <b>Til Ole Bergmann:</b> Yeah I mean at least some inspiration, I think there were some important topics raised we're going to look into. If you have any ideas any concerns suggestions just drop an email, I'm happy to consider any advice or opinion.<br><br>

      <b>Lennart Verhagen</b>: Fantastic and likewise for people who are ready and available to help out; please do reach out to Til and to the others involved and we'll get that sorted. But this is also a good cue for me to see if Brad is available. I give the floor to you.<br><br>

      <b>Bradley Treeby:</b> I'm gonna keep this fairly brief because I've spoken on this topic already a couple of times and make sure that we finish on time. This is a kind of a summary update and a roadmap for what the planning group are doing next.<br><br> 
                             So if you remember what our objective was; it was to start on the route to establish some recommendations and guidelines around modelling and planning and imaging that feeds into modelling and so on. A year and half ago we set that the first thing was to investigate numerical benchmarks. So there's lots of questions we want to answer (giving examples) but before we can answer any of those we needed to establish the tools that we're using and compare them on an equal footing.<br><br>

                            Phase 1 <br>
                            The first thing we did was this idea of a benchmarking exercise where we take the models that are being used by the community and we compare them under a very well controlled scenario. Phase 1 of intercomparison was participants. We had 22 participants representing 11 models from 13 different institutions, so it was a really fantastic group effort. *shows phase 1 benchmarks*. We looked at two sources; focus bowl source and a plain piston source. The first couple of benchmarks were just in water and then in an absorbing homogeneous medium. Then we introduced a single layer bone, a multi-layer bone, a curved single layer bone, a curved multi-layer, a bone derived from a real skull and then a whole head in two different orientations. We agreed what metrics we would use and how we compare them. Then we compared every model with every other model in a cross comparison looking at things like the peak pressure and the position of the focus. Then we had all these benchmarks and all these metrics that we tried to compress it into this this kind of table; you have every model compared with every other model and then the various metrics for the various benchmarks. To give an example, we compared k-wave (reference), babel visco simulation and a difference map. If you compare the fields on a pixel by pixel basis; in the focus they agree really well so in terms of predicting the position and the size of the focus --  most of the models agreed with each other but in the pre-focal region and sometimes in the skull there was more disagreement and obviously the field is more complicated here due to standing wave pattern between the incident wave and the reflected wave.<br><br> 

                            The conclusion is that across the 11 models there's pretty good agreement. The median differences across the nine benchmarks and eleven models was less than 10% difference in the peak pressure and less than one millimeter in the position of the focus. So pretty good agreement given that lots of the models are based on different types of techniques.<br><br>

                            Phase 2 is basically the same set of benchmarksbut with elastic wave models. In this case we're going to have more transducer angles so we can look at the effect of shear waves when you come in further from normal incidents. <br><br>

                            Phase 3 is looking at mapping properties from CT images. The question here is not what's the best way but the question here is given away and a set of CT images do the models agree. So we're not answering yet, it's given now a slightlymore even more complicated skull map; do the models still agree. That's my piece.<br><br>

      <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Thanks Brad. Are there any questions, suggestions?<br><br>

      <b>Seung Schik:</b> It was very nice work, Bradley. Any comparison with respect to actual hydrophobic mapping?<br><br>

      <b>Bradley Treeby:</b> Yeah it's on the road map so I’d like to make a strong point that taking an experimental measurement and taking that as the ground truth is not always so simple, you have to be careful what you call the ground truth which is why we started with these very well defined scenarios. The next phases on that road map after we introduce the CT scan is to bring in an experimentally characterized source. Then source with CT scan and then potentially hydrophone measurements. It's all on that road map but we're taking very slow steady steps.<br><br>

      <b>Chat:</b> phase array transducers?<br><br>

      <b>Bradley Treeby:</b> Good question, so that's why we included a plain piston transducer which you could consider as one element of a phased array. So if you can simulate one element then I guess the insinuation is that you could simulate 256 or a thousand of them correctly. Phase array correction is not something we've got on the agenda at the moment. No plans exactly but it's in the back of our mind.<br><br>

      <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Thank you Brad and Til for these discussions, wonderful. We'll be meeting again of course in one month time on the third Thursday of the month and we're going to get more reports from some of the other working. Don't hesitate to get in touch with any questions or if you would like to engage with these efforts and we'll see each other probably very soon. Thank you.<br><br>

</p>
